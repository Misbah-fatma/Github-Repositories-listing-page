- Pagination has to be `server`-side
    - By default, show `10` repositories per page
    - User should be able to choose a maximum of `100` repositories per page.
- When the API calls are in progress, consider showing loaders.
- Optionally, you can provide a search bar to filter the repositories.

### Notes

- The assignment has to be done in HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can use Bootstrap and Jquery but no other library/design system is allowed.
- You're free to make assumptions, please make sure they are mentioned in the README.
- Design is for representation purposes only, you are free to modify it, but all the functionalities as shown in the design (and as listed in requirements) should be present.
- Make sure all edge cases are thought through and handled.

### Deliverables

- A Github repo link(public) of your solution, with a README to run and check things on local.
- Link to the hosted Web App.
